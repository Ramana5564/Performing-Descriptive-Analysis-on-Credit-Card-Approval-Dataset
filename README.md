# Performing-Descriptive-Analysis-on-Credit-Card-Approval-Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of performing descriptive analysis on a credit card approval dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about credit card applications, including various attributes such as gender, age, debt, Married, BankCustomer, Industry, Ethnicity, YearsEmployed, PriorDefault, Employed, CreditScore, DriverLicense, Citizen, ZipCode , Income and whether the application was approved or denied.

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, explore its distribution, and understand key statistics. Descriptive analysis is a crucial step in data exploration and can provide valuable insights for further analysis or decision-making.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `credit_card_approval_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and analysis.
- `credit_card_approval_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for analysis in CSV format.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook and perform the analysis, you'll need the following:

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
- Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis interactively.
- Required Python libraries: Ensure you have libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed. You can install them using pip:
